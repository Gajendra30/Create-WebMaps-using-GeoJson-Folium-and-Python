# Create-WebMaps-using-GeoJson-Folium-and-Python
This application will generate map with two layers:
  First layer consists of volcanoes of USA which is marked on map using Folium Marker.
  Second layer consist of polygons which are created by using GeoJson and filled with color based on population.

Application also have layer control panel by which user can remove layer which is not required.

This project is for beginners who want to learn about how GeoJson,pandas,Folium works.
I have added all necessary files required to start with.

Happy Coding!
